# React Redux Express Boilerplate

This is an isomorphic react-redux fron-tend, with an express backend starting point for all ye budding code once server anyhow enthusiasts :). Enjoy!

## Helpful tasks:

```
$ npm i               ## install deps
$ npm run dev         ## run server in dev mode
$ make build          ## build docker image
$ docker-compose up   ## run docker image
```

## PRs welcome

### Rules

* Nothing bloated please, this is a boilerplate not a kitchen sink
* Think developer experience
* Think how to reduce spin up costs
* Tests greatly appreciated!
* Code should be readable
